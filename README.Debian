Package containing set of custom scripts for common Git tasks.

Current scripts are (all in /usr/local/bin):
- git_remote_status.sh - will query remote repository for status (for example if there are new commits to be pulled)
- graph_log.sh - will show nice decorated graph (text mode) of commits
- push_branch.sh - will push current branch to origin named `origin`

NOTE: All above commands are supposed to be invoked within git repository
(directory or parent with valid `.git/` repo in it).
